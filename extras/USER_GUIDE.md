# OwnTV — User Guide & Hidden Features

A quick tour of everything OwnTV can do. Most of these are **TV‑remote (D‑pad) shortcuts** that aren't
obvious at first glance — once you know them, the app is a lot faster to live in.

> **v4.0.0+ UI Update**: The app now features a completely redesigned shell with a **fixed sidebar** nav,
> a **top bar** with live clock, weather, search, and playlist name, and **rounded panels** for crisp content.
> Navigation is faster and more stable — panels don't jump around anymore.

> Navigation basics: **D‑pad** to move, **OK/Center** to select, **Back** to go up a level. The left
> column is the **navigation panel** (Search · Home · Live TV · Movies · Series · Downloads · Guide ·
> Settings). Press **Left** from a content list to jump back to it.

> Inside **Settings**, the sections are their own column on the left — Profile · Sources & guide ·
> Appearance · Layout & navigation · Content & metadata · Playback · Network · Data & backup · App.
> Move **Up/Down** to pick a section (the settings on the right change as you go), then **Right** to
> reach them, and **Left** to come back to the sections. The search box at the top searches every
> setting in every section at once.

## 🌍 App language & first-run setup

On a fresh installation, OwnTV opens with its language selector focused before **Get Started**. Keep
**System default** to follow the TV's language, or open the selector and choose one of the 23 complete
translated languages. Each choice is shown in its own script with an English description; selecting it
updates the welcome screen immediately and returns focus to the selector.

The four main setup pages use the same OwnTV welcome design and D-pad behaviour:

1. **Welcome** — choose the interface language, then press **Get Started**.
2. **Before you start** — read the player-only disclaimer and press **I understand**.
3. **Set up OwnTV** — create a new profile or restore a backup from a local file or another device.
4. **Add playlist** — add a new M3U, Xtream, or Stalker source, use a playlist already shared by another
   profile, import a backup, or skip for now.

Change the interface language at any time under **Settings → Look & Feel → Language**. The picker is
searchable and includes **System default**. This setting translates OwnTV itself—menus, setup, player
messages, notifications, diagnostics, and companion pages. It is separate from **Settings → Metadata
(TMDB) → Language**, which controls the language of downloaded plots, titles, and artwork. App-language
changes do not alter playlists, profiles, playback engines, or sync behaviour.

Arabic uses RTL-aware navigation where logical direction should mirror. Language selection survives app
restarts, profile changes, and backup/restore. Missing strings safely fall back to English.

## 📱 Add a playlist from another device (Remote setup)

Typing an Xtream server or a long M3U URL with a TV remote is painful. **Remote setup** lets you fill
the form on another device instead.

1. **Add source → Remote.** In the first‑run wizard or **Settings → Manage sources → Add source**, pick
   **Remote** (the other option, **Manual**, is the type‑it‑here form).
2. **Open server.** The TV shows a **QR code**, a **URL**, and a **6‑digit PIN**.
3. **On a phone, tablet or computer on the same Wi‑Fi**, scan the QR (or open the URL). The page asks for the
   **PIN** shown on the TV, then shows a form with **Xtream / M3U / Stalker** tabs.
4. **Fill the form and tap “Send to TV.”** The details appear in the Add Source screen on the TV, with
   the matching type selected and the fields filled. The Stalker tab also carries optional Serial Number,
   Device ID, Device ID2, and Signature values for portals that require advanced device identification.
   On the **M3U** tab you can either type a playlist address **or** press **Or upload a playlist file**
   and pick an `.m3u` / `.m3u8` file from the computer — useful when the playlist only exists on that
   machine. The file is sent to the TV and kept there until you import it.
5. **Press Start Import on the TV** with the remote — the remote browser only fills the form; it never starts the
   import. Leave the Remote screen (Back) and the server stops automatically.

*Security:* the QR contains only the URL, never the PIN; a fresh PIN is generated each time and every
submission must include it. *Core idea from a community suggestion (PR #66 by @zarga03).*

## ⚡ Adding a playlist — per-section sync

- 🧪 **Test connection**: check a provider before you rely on it. The button sits **inside the
  Add / Edit playlist form** (so you can test details you have typed but not saved yet) **and** on each
  saved playlist row in **Settings → Manage sources**. The result popup shows whether the account is
  active, its **expiry date**, whether it is a **trial**, and **how many connections are in use out of
  the maximum** — the number behind "maximum devices reached" errors. Xtream gives all of it; M3U and
  Stalker report reachability (and for Stalker, whether the portal accepted the MAC). A test only asks
  and reports: nothing is imported or changed.
- **Run in background**: while a playlist is importing (setup wizard or Settings), press
  **Run in background** to enter the app right away — the import keeps going, and a small
  **status pill at the bottom of the screen** shows its progress ("Syncing *playlist* · N items").
- When adding an **Xtream** or **Stalker** playlist you can pick **What to sync** per section:
  **Now** imports first (you get into the app as soon as that part is ready), **Later** syncs
  in the background, and **Off** means the section is never fetched or shown. You can turn an
  Off section back on later from **Settings → Manage sources → Edit**.
- **Stalker portals default to Live Now, Movies/Series Later** because Stalker VOD has no bulk
  endpoint (~14 items per page) — the movies & series crawl runs as a background worker that
  survives app restarts. The status pill shows it running; re-syncs skip categories that haven't
  changed.
- **Re-syncs are incremental**: refreshing a playlist only writes what actually changed on the
  provider, so re-syncing big playlists is much faster.
- **Resync asks what you want**: choosing to refresh a playlist offers **Resync now** (add and update,
  keep everything you already have) or **Resync and remove missing titles** (also drop titles the
  provider no longer lists — that run only). Neither one re-imports from scratch, and neither touches
  your favourites, history, resume positions or manual ordering. If a provider answers badly,
  OwnTV refuses to remove titles rather than emptying your library.
- **M3U playlists can carry movies and series too** — tag entries in the playlist and OwnTV sorts
  them into the right tab:
  - `type="vod"`, `type="movie"` or `tvg-type="movie"` → the **Movies** grid.
  - `type="series"` or `tvg-type="series"` → the **Series** tab. Per-episode lines like
    `Show Name S01E05` (or `1x05`) are grouped into shows with seasons and episodes automatically.
  - Untagged entries stay in **Live TV**.

## 📡 Stalker / Ministra portal

Some IPTV providers use the Stalker (MAG portal) protocol — you add them with a **Portal URL**
and a **MAC address** (no username/password). Stricter portals can also require a Serial Number,
Device ID, Device ID2, or Signature. Once added, a Stalker portal behaves like any other playlist:
Live TV, Movies, Series, downloads, TMDB metadata, backup, and the playlist switcher all work the same.

### Add a Stalker source
1. **Settings → Manage sources → Add source → Stalker (MAC)** (also available in the first‑run
   setup wizard).
2. Enter the **Portal URL** (e.g. `http://host:port/c/`) and the **MAC address** your provider
   gave you (e.g. `00:1A:79:AA:BB:CC`).
3. If your provider supplied them, enter **Serial Number**, **Device ID**, **Device ID2**, and
   **Signature** under **Advanced device identification**. Leave them blank for a normal MAC-only portal.
4. (Optional) Pick a **Device model preset** for the User-Agent if your portal is picky about the
   MAG box model (MAG250/254/270/420). The default works on most portals.
5. Tap **Test connection** — it verifies the complete identity before saving, and shows the result in
   the same popup every playlist type now uses (portal accepted or refused, plus a subscription end
   date when the portal reports one).
6. **Start Import** — Live channels, Movies, and Series all populate, just like an Xtream source.

### Notes & troubleshooting
- **Series episodes** load when you open a show (episode names show as "Episode 1, 2, …" —
  Stalker portals don't provide per-episode titles).
- **EPG**: now/next on the channel preview comes straight from the portal. For the full TV Guide,
  OwnTV uses the portal's XMLTV feed if it advertises one — otherwise paste an XMLTV URL in
  **Settings → EPG**.
- **Catch-up**: channels whose portal keeps an archive get the usual catch-up features (Guide
  "Watch from start", the Live TV catch-up picker, live rewind).
- **"Portal refused the login"** — check the MAC and any advanced device-identification values
  (copy them exactly), and check the TV's
  **date & time** (Stalker validates request timestamps; a clock more than a few minutes off
  fails the handshake).
- **Stream drops after a long watch** — Stalker links expire after a few hours; OwnTV re-fetches
  a fresh link automatically (a brief re-buffer, then playback continues). Long downloads survive
  this the same way: the download resumes from where it stopped with a fresh link.

## 🗂️ Multiple playlists — switch & set a default

Have more than one playlist (e.g. a main one and a backup)? OwnTV can show them **all merged together**,
or **narrow the whole app to just one**.

- **Quick switcher (top bar):** when you have 2+ playlists, the **playlist chip in the top‑right** becomes a
  button with a **▾**. Open it to pick **All playlists** or a single playlist. Your choice applies **everywhere
  at once** — Live TV, Movies, Series, TV Guide, Search, and the Home rails (Continue Watching / Favourites) —
  and **sticks after a restart**. Home refreshes in place after you pick, so you don't have to leave and
  return to see the new source. No need to go into Settings to switch.
- **Set a default playlist (Settings → Sources):** open **Add / Edit** on a playlist and turn on
  **“Default playlist.”** That playlist becomes the one shown across the app. The Sources list shows a
  **DEFAULT** badge on it — it's a status marker, not a button.
- **Show everything again:** pick **All playlists** from the top‑bar switcher, or edit the default playlist and
  turn **“Default playlist” off**. With no default set, **every playlist is shown** (the merged view).
- **What the filter affects:** categories, channels, movies, series, the guide, search results, and the
  **Favourites** and **History** rails inside each section all respect the selected playlist. Nothing is deleted
  or re‑imported — it's only a view filter, so switching back to **All** brings everything right back.
- **Know which playlist an item belongs to:** when two or more playlists are active for a section, a compact
  provider label appears beside its categories and items in Live TV, Movies, Series and Guide. The same label
  follows Live channels into the full-screen channel/history overlays. With one playlist, the labels stay hidden.
- Your selected default is included in **Backup & Restore** (Sources section).

## 🏠 Home — Now Trending & Continue Watching

- 🔥 **Now Trending (first row):** after a playlist sync, OwnTV checks the latest TMDB movie and series
  charts against that provider's catalogue and shows up to 10 titles it can actually play. It aims for five
  movies and five series, but either type fills unused places; at least four matches are required. The panel
  shows the TMDB rank, provider match, language choice/fallback, advertised quality/HDR/audio labels, and the
  number of seasons currently available from the provider.
- **How often it changes:** the TMDB chart itself is re-downloaded only every five to eight days per playlist,
  so the same titles stay for a few days at a time. Matching still runs after every sync, so anything new in
  your provider's catalogue can join the row the same day. Changing the metadata language does not pull a
  refresh forward — Trending switches language at its next download.
- **Trending controls:** use **Play/Open Episodes**, **Trailer**, **More Details** (full plot, cast and genres),
  or **All Versions**. Previous/Pause/Next controls sit below the showcase. The timer pauses while focus is on
  one of the four main actions and continues on the three navigation controls unless you manually pause it.
  Moving inside Trending never scrolls the Home page; Up/Down scroll only when focus crosses to another row.
- **When it appears:** Trending is enabled by default and requires Home to be shown plus **Provider + TMDB**
  or **TMDB only** under **Settings → Metadata (TMDB)**. Its separate **Settings → Home screen → Now
  Trending** option turns it On/Off; it is always the first Home row when enabled and disappears when off.
  The note explains that 4–10 items are shown only when TMDB trends match playable movies or series in your
  provider catalogue. The per-profile choice is included in backup/restore, but downloaded results are not.
- **Watch a Trending build:** during a catalogue sync, the bottom status pill can use a second line for the
  candidate fetch, provider-title preparation, movie/series matching, season loading and final publishing.
  It disappears when the build completes, like the normal sync status.
- The **Home** tab opens to a row of what you were watching — partly‑watched **movies, episodes and recent
  live channels**, newest first.
- **Dwell to expand:** hold focus on a hero card for **3 seconds** and it widens to a big 16:9 preview and
  starts a **muted video preview** — which you can turn off with **Play video in the hero row**
  (Settings → Home screen → Keep Watching); it starts off on a low‑memory TV. Press **OK**
  to **resume right where you left off**. When **TMDB metadata** is available, the expanded hero shows a
  **landscape backdrop**, the show's **title logo**, a short **plot** and a **Play** action.
- Below are more rows — **Favourite Channels**, **Continue Watching Movies/Series**, and an optional
  **Recent Channels** row (off by default). **Continue Watching series** tiles resolve **episode/show
  artwork from TMDB** when available and show as **landscape cards** (with a `S## E##` chip and a
  progress bar), falling back to the provider poster otherwise.
- ▶️ **"Continue" chip (top bar, every screen):** a compact chip resumes your **most‑recent** item in one
  press — **Resume** a movie, **Next up** an episode, or your **Last channel** — labelled with the title.
  Reach it from the navigation panel (like the search pill); it hides when there's nothing to resume.
- 🧩 **Make Home yours (Settings → Home screen, per profile):** use the separate **Now Trending** On/Off
  option, **reorder or hide the other Home rows**, **filter the Keep Watching hero** (include/exclude live
  channels, movies, series), and switch the live‑channel rows
  between **Cards** and **On Now** — an inline mini‑guide showing what's airing now with a progress bar and
  the next hours (Up/Down picks a channel, Left/Right scrolls the timeline, OK tunes). The **Android TV
  home** toggle also lives on this page. Your layout is saved per profile and included in backups.
- 🧭 **Trim the side menu to your playlist (Settings → Sidebar Menu Customization):** a VOD‑only playlist
  no longer shows Live TV / Guide, and a Live‑only playlist hides Movies / Series / Downloads. Switch
  **Behavior** to **Dynamic** and the six side‑menu icons auto‑adapt to what the active playlist actually
  contains (Home & Settings always show; counts refresh after every sync), or keep **Static** (the default)
  and manually toggle any icon on or off. Your choice is included in backups.

## 📺 Live TV

- **Categories** are in the second column. Long category names **wrap to two lines** so they're never cut off.
- ⏪ **Catch-up category**: between **History** and **All** sits **Catch-up**, holding every channel your
  provider keeps a recording for. It only appears if you have such channels. Sorting, the search box and
  the in-player channel list all work inside it, like any other category. The catch-up picker looks back
  **up to seven days** — the same span the TV Guide offers — limited by what each channel's provider
  actually keeps.
- ⏭️ **Catch-up plays on**: when a catch-up programme ends, the next one in the guide starts by itself,
  so an evening's catch-up runs through like live television. Once you reach the programme that is on
  the air **now**, OwnTV switches to the live channel — its recording is only half made. Where the guide
  has nothing after it (or a gap over three hours) playback simply stops. Governed by
  **Settings → Video player → Auto‑play next episode**; turning that off turns this off too.
- **Live preview**: focus a channel and its video plays in the preview pane (with the **real stream
  resolution**, e.g. `1080p`/`4K`, so a mislabelled "4K" channel can't fool you). Toggle this in
  **Settings → Video player → Live TV → Live preview**; sound for the preview is **Preview audio**,
  just below it. Both are also on the quick-toggle chips at the top of Settings.
  If the Live Preview panel is hidden through Panel Width Adjustment, preview video stays off and the
  toggle explains that the panel needs a width above 0% before video can be enabled again.
- 🖼️ **The preview pane is info-only now.** There are **no buttons** in it — Favorite, Rename, Hide,
  Match EPG and Catch-up all live in the **long-press menu** (below). Because nothing in the pane is
  focusable, **right-arrow no longer drops you onto the buttons by accident** — D-pad stays in the
  channel list. A short note at the bottom reminds you: **OK to watch fullscreen · long-press for options**.
- 🏷️ **Channel info row**: under the name, small chips show the channel's **real category** (so a
  channel you reached via Favorites / History / All still shows the category it actually belongs to),
  its **genre** with a colour dot, **catch-up** availability (with days, e.g. `Catch-up · 7d`), and
  **EPG coverage** (`EPG · Nd` when the stored guide span is known, else `EPG` / `No EPG`). Unmatched
  categories get a neutral grey **Other** dot — every channel has a genre marker.
- 📺 **Now playing on every row**: each channel in the list shows the **programme currently airing**
  (a small line under the name) when guide data is available — so you can see what's on at a glance.
  Channels with no guide show a single line as before.
- ⭐ **Add to Favourites (and more)**: **long‑press OK** on a channel to open the quick menu — **Favourite,
  Rename, Hide, Match EPG, Catch‑up, Play in external player**. (Closing it returns you to the same channel.)
- 📼 **Catch‑up from the channel list**: the long‑press **Catch‑up** picker lists recent programmes; picking
  one opens the **same programme popup as the Guide** — description and times, then **Watch from start**,
  **Watch channel**, favourite the channel, or close.
- 🎯 **Match EPG is smarter**: the picker lists **guide channels similar to the channel's name first**
  (best match on top; searching re‑ranks too), and the **Close / Clear match** buttons sit in a column on
  the **right** — press **Right** from any row to reach them. The same right‑side layout applies to the
  Guide's **Auto‑match review** popup (**Accept all / Skip all / Done**).
- 🔄 **Move channels** (reorder within folders/Favorites): **long‑press OK** on a channel and choose **Move** —
  a full‑screen reorder overlay opens with the full list. Use **D‑pad Up/Down** to move the item, **OK** to save,
  **Back** to cancel. Move switches the list to **Playlist order** while you reorder (that is the only order a
  manual position is visible in); saving keeps it there, and **Back/cancel puts your previous sort back**. Your
  reorder is saved across playlist re‑syncs and included in backups.
- **Open a channel full‑screen**: press **OK**.
- 🔀 **Page long lists with CH+/Rewind and CH−/Fast-forward**: with hundreds of categories or thousands of
  channels, hold‑scrolling top‑to‑bottom is painful. **CH− or Fast-forward** skips N items **down** (toward the
  last), while **CH+ or Rewind** skips N items **up** (toward the first) — in whichever panel has focus (the
  category column **or** the channel list). A **long press** jumps straight to the matching last/first item.
  Skips are clamped at the ends,
  so a short list reaches the end in one press for free. (Long‑press is disabled on the built‑in **All**
  list — jumping to the 170,000th item is pointless — but short‑press skipping still works there.) Set the
  skip counts or change these assignments in **Settings → Content → Remote Shortcuts** (default: on, 10 items
  per press). The same actions work in **Movies**, **Series** (grid + episode list), and both the category
  and item lists in **Settings → Customize Categories & Items**.

### Inside the full‑screen live player
- 🗓️ **Top bar**: bring up the controls (press OK) and one strip across the top shows **back · channel
  logo · quality/audio chips · channel name**, then the **Now / Next** programmes with times (from your
  EPG, or the provider's short guide). The Now line has a thin progress bar and the minutes left, and
  updates by itself. It's informational only — it never takes D‑pad focus.
- **Left key → channel list**: with the on‑screen controls hidden, press **Left** to pop up a **channel
  list overlay** for the browse context the channel was opened from — **Favorites, History, All Channels,
  a provider folder or a custom category** (its name is the heading) — scroll and **OK**
  to switch channels without leaving full‑screen. Each row also shows the **current programme** (small
  line) so you can pick by what's on. Press **Back** to close it.
- 🗂️ **Left again → category browser**: from that channel list, press **Left** a second time for a list of
  **every Live TV category** (hidden ones left out, renames and your manual order kept). **OK** reloads the
  channel list with that category's channels — the stream keeps playing — and **CH+/−** then surfs the
  category you picked. Your current category is highlighted and focused first; **Back** or **Left** returns
  to the channel list unchanged.
- **Right key → History list**: press **Right** with the controls hidden for the **last 30 channels you
  watched**, so you can hop back without leaving full screen. Press **Right** again, or **Back**, to close.
- ⓘ **Stream info** is the right‑most button on the control bar; **Back** exits full screen (there's no
  separate exit button).
- **CH+ / CH− always zap**, even just after the channel starts, while the controls are visible, or during
  a player-engine handoff. This applies for the whole Live TV or catch-up player session, including a
  channel opened from the Guide, Home, startup or an Android TV launcher shortcut. They move through the
  same playback context: **CH+ goes to the next channel** and **CH− to the previous one**. The list wraps,
  so CH− on the first channel lands on the last, and CH+ on the last returns to the first. Browse screens
  still use their configurable CH+/CH− paging shortcuts.
- **D-pad Up/Down and media Next/Previous** zap in the same direction as CH+/CH−. D-pad Up/Down zap only
  while the controls are hidden — with the control bar up they navigate it. On the channel-list overlay,
  Up/Down move through the rows normally.
- 🔢 **Type a channel number to tune**: in full screen, just **key in the number** (number row or numpad)
  and OwnTV switches to that channel. The digits show top‑left with a **bar that drains over two seconds**
  before it submits — press **OK** to go immediately, **Back** to cancel, or keep typing (five digits submit
  on their own). When it resolves, the same card turns into the **channel card** (logo · name · number) and
  holds until the channel is on screen; if nothing matches you get **"Channel not found"**.
  - The number is your **provider's channel number**, looked up in the **playlist you're watching**. Only
    if that playlist has no such channel are your other active Live playlists searched.
  - **Hidden channels and categories are skipped** and renamed channels show your name. If a playlist uses
    one number for several visible channels you'll see **"Multiple channels"** instead of a guess.
  - **CH+ / CH−** keeps working straight after a numeric jump, even when the channel is far outside the
    list you opened. Numbers are shown in the **Live TV channel list** and the **channel‑list overlay** (in
    a column ahead of the name), in the **full‑screen top bar** before the channel name, and on the player's
    channel card — so you can learn the ones you use.
  - Number keys are only captured on a **live channel in full screen** — during **catch‑up or timeshift**
    they're left alone.
  - **"Channel numbers"** (on by default) controls all of this — in **Settings → Video Player → Live TV**,
    or as a **quick‑toggle chip** at the top of Settings. Off hides every number and ignores the number
    keys; nothing is lost, and turning it back on restores them.
- 🔧 **Compatibility mode (two playback engines)**: live channels play on the fast **ExoPlayer** engine by
  default. If a channel shows **UHD artifacts**, won't open, or stutters, bring up the controls and press the
  **engine toggle (the ⇄ MPV/EXO pill)** — this **pins that channel to the mpv engine**. The pill always shows
  the engine that's **actually playing** (teal while on mpv, whether you pinned it or OwnTV auto‑switched), and
  **one tap always flips** the engine — a small "Switched to MPV/ExoPlayer" note confirms it. It's **remembered
  per channel and in both directions**, so that one channel always uses the engine you chose while everything
  else follows your setting.
  Your choice **holds for the rest of that channel's playback** — OwnTV will not switch you back a couple of
  seconds later — and the engine you picked is given a real try in **both stream formats**. The next time you
  open the channel it starts on your engine again, this time with the full fallback available, so a channel
  that engine genuinely cannot play still ends up somewhere that plays it instead of on a spinner.
- 🏛️ **Which engine channels start on is up to you**: **Settings → Video Player → Live TV player**
  offers **ExoPlayer, then mpv** (the default), **mpv, then ExoPlayer**, **ExoPlayer only** and **mpv only**.
  The first two just change which engine gets the first go; the **only** choices switch off the automatic
  handover altogether. That handover costs a few seconds of black screen every time it happens, so if you
  already know the second engine never works on your TV or with your provider, turning it off makes every
  failing channel give up quickly instead of stalling. **Only** still tries that engine's own two stream
  formats — what it drops is the other engine. A channel you pin by hand ignores the setting either way.
  **Live TV player per playlist** right below it applies a different choice to one provider only: pick
  the playlist, then the value, with **Follow setting** as the default. Your own per-channel pin still
  wins over it, and a protected (DRM) channel still plays on ExoPlayer whatever either setting says.
- 🔒 **Protected (DRM) channels** — some providers publish channels locked with **Widevine** or
  **ClearKey**, with the unlock address written into the playlist. These now play, with nothing for you
  to set up: the unlocking is done by the component already built into your TV, so there is no key to
  enter and no licence to buy. Such channels **always use ExoPlayer** (mpv cannot request an unlock
  key), so the engine toggle is hidden for them and your engine setting does not apply. They also
  always play inside OwnTV even if you have chosen an external player, because no external player can
  be given the unlock address. Two caveats, both decided by the device rather than by OwnTV: older or
  cheaper boxes may only be permitted to play protected channels in **standard definition**, and a few
  will refuse them entirely.
  **A channel that won't play is worked through every combination.** With two engines and (when **Prefer HLS**
  is on) two stream formats there are four ways to open a channel, and one that defeats a given pairing is
  often fine on another. A failing channel now steps through them in a fixed order, each tried once, starting
  from whichever engine it opened on: ExoPlayer+HLS → ExoPlayer+TS → mpv+HLS → mpv+TS, or the same list led by
  mpv. With Prefer HLS off — or on a channel your playlist has no HLS version of — the HLS steps drop out and
  it is simply one engine to the other. Turn on **Detailed playback logging** to see each step it took.
- ⏳ **A busy channel waits instead of failing**: if the provider answers a channel change with "too many
  connections, come back in a few seconds" — usually because the channel you just left is still counted as
  open — OwnTV keeps the spinner up, shows the reason with a **live countdown** (e.g. *HTTP 429: Channel limit
  has been reached. Retrying in 10s.*) and **retries by itself** when the time is up. Don't press Retry; just
  wait. Changing channel or pressing Back cancels it, and if the provider stays full you get the normal error
  screen after a few attempts.
- 📶 **Prefer HLS for Live TV (Xtream only)**: Xtream panels can serve a live channel either as raw MPEG‑TS or
  as an HLS playlist. OwnTV asks for **MPEG‑TS**, which is what most panels serve best — but if your provider's
  live channels are unstable, turn on **Prefer HLS for Live TV** when adding the source, or later in
  **Settings → Manage sources → (your source) → Edit**. It's stored **per source**, so with two providers you
  can prefer HLS on one and leave the other alone. It applies to **Live TV only** — catch‑up and timeshift are
  always requested as MPEG‑TS, because the provider's archive server serves recordings straight off disk and
  has no HLS version of them. The ⓘ **Stream info** overlay has a **Format** row showing which one you're
  actually receiving.
- 🧪 **Test HLS support**: the button just above that toggle checks whether your provider really serves HLS —
  it asks the panel what it supports and then actually requests an HLS channel to see what comes back. It works
  before the playlist has been synced, so you can check while adding it. The toggle stays available whatever the
  test says: some panels serve HLS without advertising it, so the result is advice, not a lock.
- 🔇 **Audio with no picture**: if a channel ever plays sound but shows a black screen, OwnTV now detects this
  automatically and switches engines for you (briefly shows a loading spinner). If neither engine can render
  video for that stream, you'll see a clear on‑screen message instead of a silent black screen.
- ⏪ **Catch‑up / rewind live**: on a channel that supports catch‑up (look for the marker, or use the
  long‑press **Catch‑up** menu), you can **rewind into the provider's archive** and play back from the past,
  then return to live.
- 🕐 **Go back to…**: on those channels the bottom bar also has a **Go back to…** button. It lists times
  counted back from now — `21:30`, `19:00`, `Sun 20:00` — so going three hours back is one press rather
  than holding rewind. The last row, **Choose exact time…**, opens a **day / hour / minute** picker so
  *yesterday at 10:31* is reachable: press **OK** on the day, hour or minute to step into it, change it
  with **up / down**, then **OK** or **Back** to step out — left and right move between the three. The
  picker stops at both ends of your archive, so you can't pick a time that doesn't exist.
  **None of this needs a TV guide** — the same list appears if you open the long‑press **Catch‑up** menu on
  a channel with no guide data, in place of the programme list.
- 🕰️ **Clock, and the programme's own time**: the player shows the time and date at the top centre in every
  mode. While you're replaying a recording it splits into two: **Programme time** (when what you're
  watching originally aired, counting forward as it plays) and **Current time**. The guide card also gains
  a **Playing / Then** row above the live one, showing what was on air at that moment and what followed —
  so even after jumping to a bare time you can see what you landed on.

## 🗓️ TV Guide (EPG)

- Open **Guide**. It loads instantly and opens scrolled to **now**.
- **Sort** the guide: A–Z · Provider · Live TV order · **Catch‑up** (archive‑capable channels first).
- ▶️ **Play catch‑up from the guide**: move **Right** into the timeline to a **past programme**, press
  **OK** to open its details, then choose **"Watch from start"** to replay it from the archive. Scroll
  **Left/Right** along the timeline to pick the programme you want.
- 📍 **Live "NOW" marker & Jump to Now**: Guide opens with the current time around **37.5% across the
  timeline**, rather than tight against the channel list, and immediately includes two recent hours so the
  current programme has readable context on its left. An amber **NOW · time** badge sits in the ruler and a
  matching line fades down every programme row. Both update every 30 seconds while Guide stays open.
  Pressing **OK** to enter a programme row keeps that same timeline position; Guide scrolls only when the
  highlighted programme reaches an edge. **Jump to Now** (top‑right) returns to the same live position after
  browsing the catch‑up archive.
- ↔️ **Resize Guide's two columns:** **Settings → Layout → Guide Column Widths** adjusts the pinned channel
  list and EPG timeline from **10% to 90%** in 5% steps. Their total must be exactly **100%** before Save works.
  Turning customization off restores the standard **10% channels / 90% timeline** split without forgetting
  your values; the setting is included in Backup & Restore.
- ↻ **Catch‑up & genre hints**: programmes you can rewind from show a ↻ badge, and each channel label
  carries a small colour dot hinting at its **genre**, based on the channel's **category name**:
  🟢 green = sport · 🔴 red = news · 🟣 violet = movies/film/cinema · 🟡 amber = kids/animation ·
  🔵 blue = music · 🩵 teal = documentary. Channels whose category doesn't match any of these show
  **no dot** (a missing dot is intentional — better than a misleading colour). The dot reflects the
  channel's category/group, not its individual name, so it depends on how your provider names its
  categories. (The **Live preview** info row uses the same colour system, but there unmatched
  categories show a neutral grey **Other** dot so every channel still has a genre marker.)
- 📋 **Cursor preview strip**: while browsing a row (move **Right** into the timeline), a strip at the
  bottom shows the programme under the cursor — title, channel, time, runtime, catch‑up, synopsis —
  without opening it. Press **OK** to open the full details.
- **EPG is opt‑in**: add guide feeds in **Settings → EPG Sources**. After importing a playlist you'll be
  offered a one‑tap **sync now** (with a live programme count), or you can sync later from Settings.
  During first‑run setup that sync also has a **Run in background** button — enter the app while the
  guide keeps downloading.
- 🔄 **EPG sync status**: when a guide feed is downloading (a manual resync or the automatic startup/
  staleness refresh), the same **status pill** that reports playlist syncs shows "Updating guide ·
  *source* · N programmes" at the bottom of the screen. When a **playlist sync finishes** the same pill
  shows the result for a few seconds — "Sync complete · *source* · N categories added", or "Sync
  failed"/"Sync cancelled" — so you always know how a resync ended; if several finish back-to-back
  they queue and show one after another.
- ⭐ **Favourites from the Guide**: **long‑press a channel label** to add/remove it from Favourites
  (the same menu also holds the EPG match options), or use the **Favourite** button inside a
  programme's details. Favourites apply everywhere — Live TV, Search, and the Home Favourites rail.
- **Auto‑match EPG**: the guide can smart‑match your channels to guide data; you can also fix one channel
  manually via the long‑press channel menu.
- 🕰️ **Guide time offset** — if the whole guide sits a few hours away from what is actually on screen
  (a provider publishing its XMLTV in another time zone), set **Settings → EPG → Guide time offset**
  (−12 h to +14 h, 15‑minute steps). For a single channel that is wrong on its own — typically an
  East/West feed sharing one guide — use the **long‑press channel menu** in Live TV or the Guide and set
  an offset just for it; that overrides the global one. The correction shows up everywhere the guide is
  used (grid, Now/Next, "On now" rows, catch‑up), and a resync never undoes it.
- 🙈 **Hidden categories stay hidden**: categories you hide via long‑press → Customize are excluded
  from the Guide too — the "Category" dropdown and the guide rows both respect them (category
  renames and manual order carry over from Live TV as well).
- 🖼️ **Use this guide's channel logos (per EPG source)**: when adding or editing an EPG feed
  (Settings → EPG Sources), turn this on to show that feed's own channel logos instead of your
  playlist's — everywhere channels appear. Channels the feed has no logo for keep the playlist logo.
  Your playlist logos are never overwritten, so turning it off restores them instantly. Re-sync the EPG
  source once after switching it on, so the logos get stored.
- 🔄 **Auto refresh (per source)**: each **playlist** (Settings → Manage sources) and each **EPG feed**
  (Settings → EPG sources) has an **Auto refresh** dropdown — **Off** (default), **Refresh at startup**,
  or an interval (EPG 1–48h). For **playlists** the choices are **6 hours**, **12 hours** or
  **Custom interval…**, which opens a day picker: **Left/Right change the number by one** (hold to
  repeat), anywhere from **1 to 99 days**. Playlists already set to the old 24h, 48h or 7-day options
  move across automatically to 1, 2 and 7 days. Intervals refresh only when the source is actually stale,
  checked on app start and when you return to the app. Everything stays **Off** until you turn it on.

## 🎬 Movies & 📺 Series

- **Grid / List toggle**: switch the poster wall to a compact **List** view (top‑right button) to scan many
  titles at once.
- 🖼️ **Episode Grid / List toggle**: inside a show, the same button (next to **Sorting**) swaps the episode
  rows for a wall of **episode pictures**. Your choice applies to every show. Episodes the metadata service
  doesn't recognise show the show's own artwork with the **episode number** across the middle, so the grid
  stays readable; in **Provider only** mode every tile looks that way.
- 🔀 **Page the grid/list with CH+ / CH‑** — see **Live TV** above. Works on the category column and the
  poster grid/list (and the episode list inside a series); long‑press jumps to first/last.
- **Detail pane**: focus a title to see its **poster, rating, plot** and **Play/Resume · Favourite ·
  Download** buttons.
- **Resume**: partly‑watched titles offer **Resume** (vs. Play). Choose how this behaves in
  **Settings → Resume** — **Ask**, **Auto** (silently continues), or **Never**.
- ⏭️ **Auto‑play next episode**: when an episode ends, the next one starts automatically — and it rolls into
  the **next season** when the current one finishes. The same switch also carries **catch-up** on to the
  next programme in the guide (see Live TV). Toggle in **Settings → Video player → Auto‑play next episode**.
- ⏳ **Next‑episode countdown**: in the last ~30 seconds of an episode a card counts down to the auto‑advance,
  with **Play now** (jump immediately) and **Cancel** (stop the auto‑advance for this episode).
- Series **open on your last‑watched episode**.
- ✅ **Watched state at a glance**: episodes (Series) and movie posters/list rows show a ✓ (dimmed) once
  watched to ≥95%, and a thin progress bar when part‑watched. Series season chips show a `watched/total`
  count (e.g. `Season 2 · 8/18`).
- ✏️ **Mark a movie watched / unwatched**: long‑press a movie → **Mark as watched** (or **unwatched**). A
  **Resume <time>** label appears under the poster in the detail pane while a movie is part‑watched.
- ▶️ **"Next up" card** (Series): the episode detail pane shows a **Next up** card with a one‑press
  **Play** for the episode to continue with — the one you're mid‑way through, or the next after the last
  finished one (resume time shown when in progress).
- 🙈 **Hide watched** (Series, header button): filters the episode list to what's left to watch.
- ↕️ **Sorting** (Series, header button): opens a popup with two rows — **Seasons** and **Episodes** — each
  switching between **Oldest first** and **Newest first**. The choice is saved **per show and per profile**,
  so a daily-news series can stay newest-first while everything else stays in normal order. It only changes
  the display order; nothing about watched state or playback changes.
- ✏️ **Mark as watched / unwatched** (Series): long‑press an episode → **Mark as watched** (or **Mark as
  unwatched** if already watched) to correct the auto‑detected state without playing it. Marking watched
  restarts the episode from the beginning next time you press Play.
- 🔄 **Move movies/series** (reorder within categories/Favorites): **long‑press OK** on any title and choose **Move** —
  a full‑screen reorder overlay opens. Use **D‑pad Up/Down** to move, **OK** to save, **Back** to cancel.
- 📥 **Download via long‑press**: **long‑press OK** on a movie or episode and choose **Download** to queue it
  immediately (Movies) or queue all cached episodes (Series). No need to open the detail pane.
- 📤 **Play with external player via long‑press**: the same long‑press menu can open the movie/episode in an
  external app (VLC, MX Player, …) — one‑off, regardless of the global **External player** setting.
- 🔧 **Two playback engines with automatic fallback**: movies/episodes play on **mpv** by default —
  **Settings → Video Player → Movies & Series player** offers the same four choices as Live TV
  (**mpv, then ExoPlayer** by default, **ExoPlayer, then mpv**, **ExoPlayer only**, **mpv only**). If the
  chosen engine can't play an item, the **other engine is tried automatically** before any error — unless
  you picked one of the **only** choices, which never switch engines. Note that **ExoPlayer only** cannot
  play **DTS or TrueHD** audio at all; those files need mpv. Each engine is given both its
  hardware and its software decoder before the other is tried, so a video gets four chances in all. A
  fallback is **never remembered** — the next item, and the same item next time, always starts on the
  engine you chose. You can also switch the **current**
  movie/episode manually: bring up the controls and press the **engine toggle (the ⇄ MPV/EXO pill)** — it
  flips between mpv and ExoPlayer at the same position (the pill shows the active engine; teal while on
  ExoPlayer, and a small "Switched to MPV/ExoPlayer" note confirms it). Handy when one engine doesn't show a
  subtitle or audio track you know exists — flip and check. Like Live TV's compatibility mode, the choice is
  **remembered for that movie/episode** — it opens on that engine from then on, while other items keep
  following the setting.
- 🏷️ **Which engine is playing?** The player top‑left mini chips now start with **MPV** or **EXO** (on Live
  TV too), so you always know the active engine at a glance.
- 🏷️ **Bitrate in the top‑bar chips.** The mini chips also show the stream's **bitrate** (Mbps) when the
  provider declares it — for Live TV (preview & full), movies and series, on both engines. Raw `.ts`
  live channels that don't declare a bitrate leave it blank; open the **info overlay (ⓘ)** for a live
  measured value.

## 🎬 TMDB metadata (posters, plots, cast, trailers)

- **Current layout:** Metadata has its own page. The active source is shown at the top; built-in-service users get separate **minute, hour and day** allowance cards plus refill time. **Get advanced TMDB info via remote** opens a compact popup for a personal API key, Worker/server URL, or QR + PIN remote hand-over. A URL takes priority over a key, and leaving both blank uses OwnTV's shared service.

- **Settings → Metadata (TMDB):** **Metadata source** opens a picker — *Provider only* (no TMDB),
  *Provider + TMDB* (default; your playlist's info wins, TMDB fills the blanks and adds
  cast/genres/backdrops), or *TMDB only* (prefer TMDB). Turn on **Advanced options** to use your own TMDB
  API key or a self-hosted server; otherwise the built-in shared server is used with no setup. A
  "Test lookup" button verifies it works. Switching **Advanced options** off asks for confirmation and
  then deletes the saved key and server address, returning you to the shared service.
- 📊 **Your daily share** (top of the screen) — the built-in metadata service is shared by everyone using
  OwnTV, so each device gets its own allowance each day: **40 a minute, 150 an hour, 400 a day**, shown as
  a single **Usage** line with the time it refills. Normal browsing uses a fraction of it. If you do run
  out, posters and descriptions pause until it refills and OwnTV tells you once — your playlist's own
  info keeps working as normal throughout. The rows appear only when you are on the shared service: your
  own key or your own server is your resource and is never counted.
- 🌍 **Language** — pick the language TMDB descriptions, titles and artwork come back in: **Default
  (English)**, **Device language**, or one of 40 languages (the list is searchable). Details are cached
  **per language**, so switching to another language and back is instant and costs no re-downloads.
- 💡 **Recommended: use your own TMDB API key** (free for personal / non-commercial use) or a self-hosted
  server. Keys are typically issued instantly — no waiting period or manual approval — and a personal key
  has **practically no daily limit**, so you are never rationed. Create one at
  [themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and hit **Test lookup**.
- 📱 **Get key from another device** — a TMDB key is 32 characters, which is miserable to type with a remote
  (and TMDB's own signup page is not designed for TV). Under **Advanced options**, pick **Get key from
  another device**: the TV shows a QR code and a PIN, you open it on a phone, tablet or computer on the same Wi-Fi, sign in to
  TMDB there, paste the key and send it across. It lands in the key field on the TV — press **Save** to
  use it. As with the other Remote features, the QR carries only the address, never the PIN.
- 🌐 **Self-host your own metadata server (free):** a ready-to-deploy Cloudflare Worker is in the repo at
  [`extras/worker/tmdb/`](worker/tmdb/) — [`extras/worker/tmdb/README.md`](worker/tmdb/README.md) has the
  full step-by-step (deploy with `wrangler`, set your TMDB key as a secret via
  [`extras/worker/tmdb/wrangler.toml`](worker/tmdb/wrangler.toml) + `wrangler secret put TMDB_KEY`, then
  paste your `https://….workers.dev` URL into **Settings → Metadata → Self-host server URL**). Your key
  stays on your Cloudflare account, responses are edge-cached for 30 days, and a server of your own is
  never subject to the shared service's daily share.
- **Movies/Series details:** focus a title to see enriched info in the side pane. **Long-press** a poster for
  Favorite, Download and **TMDB Details** — a scrollable window with the backdrop, full plot, genres and the
  **cast as photos** (portraits with names, wrapping across as many rows as needed; actors TMDB has no photo
  for show their initials). Press **Back** to close. **Single-press** plays.
- 🙈 **Hide a movie or series:** long-press a title → **Hide** removes it everywhere at once — global Search,
  the section search, its category, the All list, Home rails (Continue Watching / Favourites), the Android TV
  Watch Next row, and Downloads. The downloaded file is kept, and the title comes back the moment you unhide it
  from **Settings → Customize Categories & Items**. (Hiding a whole **category** now hides its items everywhere too,
  matching Live TV.)
- **Series & episodes:** open a series to see the episode list with a detail pane on the right — focus an
  episode to see its TMDB still, plot and rating. Episode rows: **single-press plays**, **long-press** for
  Download / TMDB Details.
- **Sorting:** the sort chip cycles **Provider → A–Z → Rating → Date added**. Rating shows the highest-rated
  titles first. **Date added** shows the newest titles first, using the date your provider stamped on each
  movie/series; titles with no date fall to the bottom in playlist order.
  **A–Z also sorts the category folders** (in Live TV too) — categories you manually reordered in
  **Settings → Customize** stay pinned at the top; the rest sort alphabetically below them.
- **Refetch TMDB details:** long-press a movie, series, or episode → **Refetch TMDB details** forces a fresh
  TMDB search — it clears a wrong/stale match (or a 7-day "no match" cache) and re-searches at once, so you
  don't have to wait for the cache to expire. Use it when the art/plot is missing or looks wrong.
- **Set TMDB name:** long-press a movie or series → **Set TMDB name** opens a dialog
  pre-filled with the cleaned title; type the exact TMDB title (and an optional year to disambiguate) and
  Save forces a fresh TMDB search under that name. Clear removes the override and re-searches with the
  cleaned provider title. The escape hatch when matching still gets a title wrong (or it's stuck in the
  7-day "no match" cache).
- 🎞️ **Trailers:** long-press a movie or series → **Play Trailer** (shown only when TMDB has one). The trailer
  plays full screen inside OwnTV: **Back or Exit** closes it, **◀/▶** seeks ±10 seconds. The embedded player
  keeps YouTube's extra controls, captions, annotations and related-video layer off, and updates OwnTV's
  progress display once per second to stay smoother on lower-memory TVs. If the system WebView cannot play
  the video at all, OwnTV falls back to the YouTube app or browser.
- **Attribution:** OwnTV uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB.

---

## 🕐 History

- Browse **recently watched movies, series and channels**.
- ✂️ **Remove single item**: **long‑press OK** on any history item and choose **Remove from History** to
  delete just that entry (keeps the rest). For a **series** this also clears where you had got to in its
  episodes, so the show leaves the Home screen's Continue Watching row and opens at episode 1 next time.
- 🧹 **Clear entire history** (by type): Settings → Content → **Clear watch history** — wipe all recently‑watched
  items, or just **Live TV, Movies or Series**. Playlists, Favorites and Downloads are untouched.

---

## 🔎 Search

- The **Search** tab searches **Live, Movies and Series together**.
- 🚀 **Launcher home**: with the box empty, Search shows a **"Jump to"** row — **Continue watching**,
  **Unwatched** and **Channels** — plus your **recent searches** as chips (tap **Clear** to wipe them).
  Tap a chip to jump straight in without typing.
- 🖼️ **Detail pane**: focus any result to see its **poster, plot and rating** on the right, with a
  **primary action** button (Play / Watch live / Open series). Pressing **OK** on the result still plays
  it directly.
- ↩️ **Back**: the first **Back** clears your query (back to the launcher); a second **Back** leaves Search.
- You can **favourite a channel straight from search** via **long‑press**.

---

## 📥 Downloads

- The **Downloads** tab groups items into **Active · Waiting · Completed · Failed**, with a **storage
  bar** at the top showing free space.
- **Long‑press / OK** a card for **Pause · Resume · Retry · Delete**. A failed download tells you to
  **Tap Retry**.
- 📍 **See it downloading without leaving the page**: when you start a download of a **movie**, a **whole
  series**, or a **single episode**, a small **status strip** (Downloading / Queued / Paused, with a
  progress bar) appears at the top of that item's **poster panel**. It only shows while a download is in
  flight and disappears once it finishes.
- 📍 **Downloads keep going when you leave the app.** A transfer runs in the background with a
  notification, one at a time, and survives OwnTV being closed or killed. Pausing saves exactly what has
  been written, so resuming picks up from there instead of starting over.
- ⚠️ If the **USB stick or SD card you are downloading to is removed**, that download is marked
  **Failed** — it will not quietly continue into internal storage.

---

## 🎛️ Player controls (reference)

Bring up the controls in any full‑screen player (press OK / a direction). The bottom bar has:

As you move along the row, **the highlighted button's name appears just above it**, so you never have
to press one to find out what it is.

| Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Subtitles** | Pick a subtitle track (incl. **image subtitles**) and set **subtitle delay**. Live channels with **embedded closed captions (CC)** — common on US channels — show a CC track on both engines; on mpv, selecting it briefly switches the channel to software decoding (≤1080p) and hardware decoding returns when CC is turned off. On raw `.ts` channels the CC entry always appears, even when the channel carries no captions. |
| **Audio** | Pick an audio track, and **A/V sync** (audio delay, **±25 ms** steps) — use this if surround makes lips drift. **Remember this delay** keeps the correction for that one channel, film or episode; everything else keeps following the global setting. Available on movies/series and on live channels in **compatibility mode** (the standard live player can't shift audio, so it isn't offered there). |
| **Info** (ⓘ) | Toggle the **stream info overlay**: codec · resolution · fps · HDR · bitrate · decoder · audio · **audio out** · buffer. **Decoder** names the decoder that is really in use and whether it is *hardware* or *software* — not what the Hardware decoding setting says — so you can see when a stream has quietly dropped to software. **Audio out** tells you whether your TV/receiver is decoding the sound (*passthrough*) or OwnTV is (*decoded in app*), whether surround is currently allowed, and why it fell back to stereo if it did. While it's open, a **share** button appears next to it: **Report this stream** saves that whole readout into the playback log, ready to export (see Settings). |
| **Favorite** (♥) | Add or remove what you're watching from **Favorites** without leaving the stream — a live channel, a movie, or a series (an episode favorites its parent show). The heart fills when it's already a favorite. |
| **Speed** | Playback speed (VOD). |
| **MPV/EXO (⇄)** | Live: **compatibility mode** — pin the channel to mpv. Movies/Series: **switch this item between mpv and ExoPlayer** (shows the active engine; teal on the non‑default one). Flipping it briefly confirms "Switched to MPV/ExoPlayer" at the bottom. |
| **Aspect/Zoom** | Change aspect ratio / zoom (works in every render mode). A zoom you set here is **remembered for that channel/film** and used every time you open it again; anything you haven't set starts from **Settings → Default zoom**. Clear the saved ones with **Settings → Video player → Reset saved zoom**. |
| **PiP** | Picture‑in‑picture for live. |
| **Headphones** | **Audio Mode** — see below. |
| **Volume** | Quiet streams can be **boosted to 150%** — movies, series and Live TV alike, whichever player they end up on (where the player can't amplify by itself the boost comes from your TV's own audio effect; a TV that doesn't support it stays at 100%). A level you set is **remembered for that channel/film**; everything else starts from **Settings → Video player → Default volume**. **Mute is not remembered**, so nothing ever opens silent. Clear the saved ones with **Reset saved volume**. |

Catch‑up channels also get a **Go back to…** button (a small TV with a replay loop) — see Live TV above.

A few things that need no button:

- **The clock is always at the top centre** — time and date, in every player. On a recording it becomes
  two: **Programme time** (when it originally aired) and **Current time**.
- **Remote transport keys work** — play/pause, next and previous from the remote, a headset or a voice
  assistant reach the player. Next/previous move between episodes in a series. With the player closed
  they do nothing to OwnTV.
- **A notification or a system sound won't pause your film** — the sound dips for a moment and comes
  back. Only another app taking the audio for good pauses playback.
- **Subtitles show in the docked mini‑player too**, sized to the small window.
- **The mini‑player's controls sit in one floating strip** just above the bottom of the little window:
  play as a large circle in your accent colour, then volume and audio mode, then size and corner, then
  fullscreen and close. Its **progress line runs along the top edge**, and the window takes an accent
  outline while the remote is inside it. **On a small window the strip thins itself out** — it keeps
  play, volume, fullscreen and close, and tucks the rest behind a **⋯** tile you press to swap them in
  and out, so nothing is ever cut off.
- **Getting back into the docked mini‑player**, three ways, from any screen: a **Now Playing** item
  appears at the top of the side menu while something is docked (or Audio Mode is running) — press
  **OK** on it to move into the window; **hold BACK** to jump straight in, and hold it again to return;
  or just press **Play/Pause** on the remote, which acts on the docked window without going near it
  (CH+/CH− change its channel too, unless the screen you are on already uses those keys). **Back** from
  inside the window puts you back on the exact control you came from.

---

## 🎧 Audio Mode (listen with the screen free)

Audio Mode plays the **sound only** and stops video decoding entirely, so you can browse the app
while the current channel, movie or episode keeps playing. A compact **now‑playing bar** appears in
the top bar — an animated equaliser, the title, and a slim progress line on a recording.

**The bar opens up when you move onto it**, and the page below slides down rather than being covered.
Opened it shows **artwork** (the station's logo when there is one, otherwise a coloured tile with the
equaliser in it), the station name, and a pulsing **LIVE** badge or how far into the recording you are.
It carries **seven controls**: back, play/pause, forward, **favourite** (the same heart as the full
player, coral when set), volume, fullscreen and **close**. The two outer buttons **change channel on a
live stream and rewind/fast‑forward on a recording**.

- **Turn it on** with the **headphones button** on the full‑screen player controls, or on the docked
  mini‑player.
- **Using the bar (D‑pad):** move focus onto it and the whole bar highlights; press **OK** to step
  **inside**. Now **Left/Right** move between the buttons and **OK** runs the highlighted one. Focus
  stays inside the bar — press **Back** to step out.
- **Fullscreen** returns to full video; **close** (✕) stops playback — **Back** only steps out of the bar.

### "Audio only" — when the item itself has no picture

Some items carry sound and nothing else: a radio station listed among your TV channels, or a
music‑only file filed under Movies. That is not a fault, and OwnTV plays them normally — but a black
screen with sound looks exactly like a broken player. After the stream has played for a few seconds
without announcing any video track, the player shows a small **Audio only** plate in the middle with
a short explanation. Waiting avoids briefly labelling a normal channel when its provider announces
audio before video. The plate stays for as long as a genuine audio‑only item plays, and shrinks to
just the music icon in the docked mini‑player.

If you see it, nothing is wrong and there is nothing to fix — the item simply has no video in it. It
is different from Audio Mode above: that one is *you* switching the picture off, this one is the
stream having none to begin with.

## 💬 External subtitles (OpenSubtitles & local files)

- **Settings → OpenSubtitles** is a dedicated main Settings page directly below Metadata. Account status, download allowance, search language, downloaded-subtitle cleanup and advanced access stay together there.
- **Sign in** first asks how you want to enter your details: **Remote** (fill them in on a phone, tablet
  or computer on the same Wi-Fi, via the usual QR + PIN companion) or **Enter here** (type them with the
  remote). Either way you end up on one compact panel holding your username, password, **Stay signed in**,
  and — underneath, marked optional — a personal OpenSubtitles API key and a custom Worker/server URL.
  A URL takes priority over a key; leaving both blank uses OwnTV's shared service. Pressing **Sign in**
  saves the optional fields too, and custom access is included in Backup & Restore.
- **Advanced options** appears as its own row only once you are signed in, for changing the key or URL
  later without signing out.
- If sign-in fails, the message now distinguishes a wrong username or password, a server that answered
  and refused (it shows the error number), and a genuine connection problem — so "check your internet"
  is only ever said when that really is the cause.

For **movies and series episodes** (streamed or downloaded), the player's **Subtitles** menu has an
**ADD SUBTITLES** section:

- **Search OpenSubtitles** — needs a free [opensubtitles.com](https://www.opensubtitles.com) account,
  connected per profile in **Settings → Video Player → Subtitles → OpenSubtitles**. The search is
  pre-filled for the playing title; use **Edit search** if the provider's name is odd, and **All
  languages** to widen it. Pick a result and it downloads, turns on immediately, and is remembered
  for that title. Your remaining daily downloads (set by OpenSubtitles per account) show in the
  account screen and after each download — re-downloading something you already fetched costs
  nothing. If you open this while not signed in, it shows a note pointing you to that Settings screen
  to connect your account.
- **Select local subtitle file** — no account or internet needed. Browse USB/internal storage for a
  `.srt` / `.ass` / `.ssa` / `.vtt` / `.webvtt` file. Non-UTF-8 files (Arabic, etc.) are converted
  automatically, and OwnTV keeps its own copy so the subtitle survives unplugging the USB.
- **Naming in the Subtitles menu** — downloads are listed as `OS_Korean · WEB-DL.NF`: the source, the
  language, and the release the subtitle came from, so several downloads in one language can be told
  apart. Files you imported yourself start with `LOCAL_` instead. The video's own built-in subtitles
  keep their original names, so they are never confused with your downloads.
- **ADJUST → Subtitle timing** — nudge the active subtitle **earlier/later** in 0.1 s / 0.5 s steps
  while the video plays. The offset is saved for that exact subtitle on that title, so each download
  keeps its own timing.
- On **replay**, previously downloaded subtitles for the title are re-listed in the Subtitles menu
  (not auto-selected) — pick one and its saved timing comes back too.
- **Deleting**: long-press a movie/episode → **Delete OpenSub subtitles**, or manage everything in
  **Settings → … → OpenSubtitles → Delete subtitles** (per profile).

## 🎛️ Remote shortcuts

Open **Settings → Content → Remote Shortcuts** to give spare buttons on your particular TV remote a useful
job. Choose **Add shortcut**, press or hold the button you want, then select its action. Short and long
presses are separate assignments, and the list marks them with compact badges beside a symbol for the
physical key. Coloured buttons appear as matching coloured keycaps.

Available actions include:

- **Open somewhere:** Home, Live TV, Movies, Series, Downloads, Guide, Global Search or Settings.
- **Switch or continue:** profile switcher, playlist switcher or the last item you watched.
- **Control Now Playing:** focus the mini player or Audio Mode bar automatically, expand to fullscreen,
  move fullscreen playback into the mini player, switch to Audio Mode, or play/pause.
- **Browse the focused panel:** page toward the first/last items or jump directly to the first/last item.
  This follows focus across Live TV, Movies, Series and Customize. Jump to last remains unavailable on a
  huge built-in **All** list so the app does not try to load tens of thousands of entries at once.
- **Player-only actions:** return to live, subtitle controls, audio-track controls, aspect-ratio controls
  and playback information. These do nothing when the current playback does not support them.

OwnTV ships with the familiar paging assignments: **CH+ or Rewind** pages toward the first items and jumps
to the first item when held; **CH− or Fast-forward** pages toward the last items and jumps to the last item
when held. The two skip counts sit at the bottom of the same screen. **Restore default shortcuts** restores
these assignments, while **Use remote shortcuts** temporarily disables every custom assignment without
deleting it.

Safety rules keep the app controllable: **Back, D-pad, OK, volume, Home and power cannot be reassigned**, and
holding **Back** always focuses Now Playing. Number buttons can run shortcuts while browsing, but in the
fullscreen Live TV player they keep their normal numeric channel-entry job. Remote shortcut assignments are
included in **Backup & Restore**.

## 🎨 Personalize (make it yours)

- 🔀 **Settings → Layout → Long-press menus**: set the order of the actions in the four long-press
  menus — **channel, movie, series and episode** — each one separately. Pick a menu and the same popup you
  see while browsing opens. **Hold OK** on an action to pick it up (a ↕ marks it), **Up / Down** to move it,
  **OK** to drop it, then **Save** — nothing is written until you do, and Back or Cancel discards. **Reset**
  restores the shipped order, per menu or for all four at once. **Close** always stays last.
  An order you set keeps working after an update: a new action is added at the end and a removed one is
  simply skipped. Reopening the editor shows the same saved order as the long-press popup itself.

- **Settings → Customize Categories & Items**: **hide, rename and reorder** categories, plus **unhide**
  individual channels, movies and series from one place. Pick a section at the top (Live TV / Movies /
  Series). Use **Filter: All / Visible / Hidden** on the category screen or inside a category to inspect only
  the entries you need without changing them; a new section/category starts on All. Hidden entries carry an
  **Unhide/Show** button. With a long provider list, use **CH+/Rewind or CH−/Fast-forward** to page it
  (long‑press = first/last entry).
  - 🗂️ **Open a category's items**: focus a category **name** and press **OK** — every channel, movie or
    series in it opens as its own list (paged, so even a huge category opens instantly). Hidden items
    show up there marked **Hidden**, with a **Show** button; each Live channel row also has **Rename**,
    and every row has the usual reorder buttons. **Back** returns to the category list.
  - ⚡ **Hide, show or rename every item at once — no separate “Hide all / Show all” button needed**:
    on the **first item**, focus the action you want (**Hide**, **Show**, or **Rename** where shown) and
    **long‑press** it to enter span mode. Then **long‑press CH−** to jump straight to the **last item**
    while keeping the whole range selected, and press the same action on that last row. Every item from
    first to last is applied together. Short‑press CH− / CH+ can skip through smaller spans;
    long‑press **CH+** returns straight to the first item.
  - ✏️ **Bulk rename (#86)**: **long‑press Rename** on a category (or an item in Live TV) to start a
    rename span, then press **Rename** on the last row — every row in between is selected. Movies and
    Series have no per‑row Rename, so their item lists get a **✎ Rename items** pill in the header that
    selects the whole category. From the popup:
    - **✎ Add rule** — add or remove a **prefix** or **suffix**. Separate several removable alternatives
      with semicolons; the case-insensitive and trim-leftovers options handle capitalization and
      separators. Rules run from top to bottom, and the **live review** shows every proposed name
      before anything is written.
    - **✨ Auto cleanup** — creates editable rules for country/provider tags, quality and codec tags,
      emoji, symbols and stray separators, then opens the same review.
    - **↺ Restore original names** — undoes a bulk rename for the whole span; the only undo, always
      available.
    Renamed names are per profile, survive re‑syncs, and show everywhere the original name does —
    Live TV, Movies, Series, search and recently‑watched.
  - 🗂️ **Custom combined categories (#87)**: press **＋ New category** at the top to create your own
    combined category for the section. It appears as its own rail at the top of Browse (Live TV /
    Movies / Series). Fill it from:
    - **Live/Movies/Series context menu → Move to category…**, or
    - the **Move to…** button on the Customize item list.
    A **"Keep in <origin> as well"** checkbox decides whether the item stays in its original folder
    or leaves it (items that leave are still findable in **All** and search; moving out of Favorites
    un‑favourites them). Combined categories can be **renamed** (its rename dialog has a **Delete**
    button — deleting removes the category, items stay in their original folders), **hidden**,
    **reordered as a block** with the span trick, and their items can be **reordered manually** with
    the row arrows. They're per profile and ride in Backup & Restore.
  - **Hide a range of categories fast**: focus a category's **Hide** button and **long‑press (select‑hold)** it to
    enter **span/range mode**. Then scroll **up or down** — every category between your starting point and the
    category you land on gets hidden together as a range. Handy for quickly hiding a big block of categories (or
    even scrolling all the way to hide most of the list) instead of hiding them one by one.
  - ↕️ **Move a block of categories together**: the same span trick works on the **move** buttons
    (**⤒ ↑ ↓ ⤓**). **Long‑press** any of them on the first category, then press an arrow on the last
    category — every category in between moves as one block: up/down a step, or straight to the
    top/bottom. The block **stays selected**, so you can keep pressing the arrows to walk it further.
    Press **Back** (or **Cancel** in the banner) when you're done. Great for lifting all your sports or
    kids categories to the top at once instead of one at a time.
  - 🗂️ **New category behavior (Show / Hide)**: at the top of the screen, choose what happens to a
    category your provider adds on a **later re-sync** — **Show** (default) or **Hide** it automatically.
    Handy if you keep only a few categories visible and don't want new ones popping up. It's per profile
    and rides in Backup & Restore; the **add-source window** has the same **"Hide new categories by
    default"** toggle, so you can set it before the first sync. When a re-sync changes categories, the
    completion message tells you how many were **added / removed**. With two or more playlists in view,
    category lists are **grouped by provider** and each Customize row shows which provider it belongs to.
  - 🔒 **Optional PIN lock**: tap **Set PIN** at the top-right to lock this screen. Once set, opening
    Customize Categories & Items asks for the PIN each time, so nobody else can unhide items or change your category
    setup. The PIN is per-profile. It rides in a backup **only when you set a backup password** — a
    four-digit PIN is trivially recovered from an unencrypted file — so a passwordless backup simply
    doesn't carry it, and restoring one never removes a lock you already have on the device.
    Change or remove it from the **Change PIN** / **Remove lock** buttons at the top-right.
- **Settings → Theme / Accent colour / UI Zoom**: dark/AMOLED/light, a tint colour, and scale the whole UI.
  - The **Accent colour** dialog has quick presets plus a full colour picker: focus the **hue bar** or the
    **saturation/brightness square**, press **OK** to step in (it glows amber), move with the **D-pad**, then
    **OK/Back** to step out. A live preview shows the result. You can also type an exact **hex code** and **Apply**.
  - The accent applies inside the **player** too — the seek bar, the active buttons and the badges. On the
    light theme the player uses the brighter version of your colour, because its controls sit on dark video.
  - ⚠️ Going **below 85% zoom** shows a warning first — lower zoom draws many more items at once, which can
    crash devices with limited memory (e.g. 2 GB TV sticks) with big playlists/EPG. Press **OK** to accept
    and continue, or **Back** to stay at 85%.
- **Settings → Focus highlight**: the colour and thickness of the ring drawn around whatever your
  remote is pointing at. Pick from **eight presets**, the full **palette**, or an exact **hex code**,
  and choose **Thin / Normal / Thick / Extra thick**. A live sample in the dialog shows the result
  before you commit; **Use this colour** saves and closes, **Reset** goes back to following the accent.
  - The choice applies everywhere — Live TV, Movies, Series, Home, the TV Guide, Downloads, Search,
    settings rows, the category column, the navigation rail, buttons, text fields and popups — and it
    works with the **Glass Effect** on, where the frosted rim takes your colour. Thicker rings also
    widen the glow around the focused item.
- **Settings → Glass Effect**: a dedicated settings page for the **frosted‑glass look** — a compact live
  preview stays at the top, and the controls below appear only while Glass Effect is on. Panels turn
  translucent with a real blurred backdrop over an optional **background photo**.
  - Choose an **Appearance preset** from the six-step clarity ladder: **Ultra Clear** (24% tint / 35%
    frost), **Clear** (38% / 62%), **Balanced** (56% / 78%), **Tinted** (74% / 88%), **Opaque**
    (92% / 100%), or **Custom** for saved manual values. Changing Transparency or Frost selects
    Custom; **Reset** restores Balanced, 55% Highlight strength, and every glass surface.
  - The page keeps **Glass effect On/Off**, the **Background image** chooser, **Transparency** (20–100%,
    higher = more solid), **Blur / Frost** (0–100%), **Highlight strength** (0–100%), full-transparency
    protection and depth effects. Frost uses ten real blur levels rather than changing only opacity.
  - The readability floor automatically strengthens floating and container glass over bright or busy
    wallpaper. **Allow full transparency** disables that protection when the clearest look matters more
    than guaranteed text contrast.
  - **Depth & shadows** controls the short focus-arrival light, subtle wallpaper parallax and focus depth
    movement. The main **Animations** setting also disables all of this motion when Animations is Off.
  - **Background image — Local or Remote.** **Local** browses USB/device storage for a JPG/PNG/WebP/BMP
    (it's copied into the app, so unplugging the stick can't blank it). **Remote** shows a **PIN + QR** —
    open it on a phone, tablet or computer on the same Wi‑Fi, enter the PIN, send a photo, and it applies instantly.
    **Clear** removes the background.
  - **Apply glass to** toggles content panels, sidebar, preview panes, dialogs & popups, top bar, cards and
    mini‑player inline. **All** is selected when every surface is active; pressing it always enables the
    complete set, while individual changes update All automatically. **Reset to Balanced** restores the
    Balanced preset, default highlight/depth behavior and every surface.
  - The frost (blur) needs a background image and **Android 12+**; otherwise panels are simply
    translucent. With no background image, enabled surfaces use a solid ceramic‑glass treatment so text
    stays readable instead of pretending to blur a flat colour.
  - Focus is designed for TV navigation: the selected control gets a directional light lens and bright
    glass rim immediately. During rapid scrolling OwnTV keeps the moving highlight lightweight, then adds
    the full frost after focus settles, avoiding the dark trailing bands older builds could leave behind.
    All glass settings are kept in backups.
- **Settings → Ambient Glow** (shown only with the explicit **Dark** theme while Glass Effect is off):
  optionally adds the setup wizard's soft teal aura to the normal solid interface. Glow is off by default.
  With **Slow pulse** off, only the soft aura is shown; turning it on adds the animated circle. Animations
  Off freezes that motion. Light/System themes and Glass Effect hide the setting and disable the effect.
- **Updated shell layout:** Live TV, Movies and Series share one rounded browse container with their
  category, content and preview/poster areas inside it. The navigation rail has a matching background plate
  and compact selection beacon. The top bar and rail use less vertical space during normal browsing, then
  expand automatically when Audio Mode needs the larger player bar.
- **Settings → Panel Width Adjustment**: set how wide the three browse panels are — the **category rail**,
  the **item list/grid** and the **preview/poster** pane — separately for **Live TV**, **Movies** and
  **Series**.
  - Each section opens a popup with **Customize panel On/Off** and a **−/+** control per panel. The values
    are **shares of the screen and must add up to 100%**: a **Total size** line shows the running total, and
    pressing **Okay** while it isn't 100% shows a note in red instead of saving, so you always take from one
    panel to give to another.
  - The third panel — **Live Preview**, **Movie Poster** or **Series Poster** — can be set to **0%** to hide
    it completely. Category and List keep their 10% minimum, and hiding the third panel also removes its
    gap so the two remaining panels use the whole row.
  - If Live Preview video is on when you save its panel at 0%, OwnTV warns first. Confirming hides the
    panel and turns preview video off; it cannot be enabled again until the panel is given a width above 0%.
  - **Reset** returns a section to the standard widths; leaving a section **Off** keeps today's layout.
    Movie and series posters re‑flow automatically, so a narrower list just shows fewer per row. Saved in
    backups.
- **Settings → Guide Column Widths**: independently divide the TV Guide between its pinned **Channel list**
  and scrolling **EPG timeline**. Each stays between 10% and 90%, moves in 5% steps, and the pair must total
  exactly 100% to save. Off uses the standard 10% / 90% split while keeping your custom values for later.
- **Settings → Animations**: turn interface motion **off** for a snappier feel on lower‑end TV boxes.
- **Profiles** (Settings → Profiles): multiple viewers, a **Kids mode**, and **PIN locks**. Kids mode
  hides adult provider categories and their items across Live TV, Movies, Series, Home, Search,
  Catch-up, Downloads, custom categories, Android TV recommendations and direct playback; it also
  hides the **Guide**. TMDB adult results are excluded only for Kids profiles, never for normal
  profiles. OwnTV recognizes adult content from provider category/folder names using common
  multilingual markers such as `18+` and `XXX` (`Adult Swim` is exempt). IPTV formats have no
  dependable universal adult flag, so misleading or uncategorized provider items cannot always be
  recognized.

## ⚙️ Settings worth knowing

- 🧱 **Two columns: sections on the left, their settings on the right.** Up/Down picks a section (each
  shows its icon and how many settings it holds), **Right** moves into the settings, **Left** comes back
  to the section you were in. Settings opens on the section you used last. Values line up in a column
  down the right‑hand edge, and an **arrow at the end of a row means it opens another screen** — rows
  without one open a popup or flip in place. Both columns scroll, so nothing is out of reach at high UI
  zoom.
- ⚡ **Quick** — the first section in the left column, holding the six most‑used switches (Live preview ·
  Preview sound · Channel numbers · HDR · Auto‑play · Check for update). Press **OK** on a row to flip
  it; the value changes without leaving the row.
- 🔎 **Search settings** — press **OK** on the **search pill** at the top right to open the box, then OK
  again to type. It filters the whole screen to matching rows; results show where the setting lives
  (e.g. `Playback › Video player › HDR`) and open it directly — or, for a simple on/off, flip it
  straight from the results. Typing `video player` lists everything on that screen. **Back** clears
  what you typed; **Back** again puts search away.
- 🧭 **Menu layout** — **Profiles** is the first row; **App startup** is under **App**; the
  **Home screen** page is under Content.
- 🎬 **Every playback setting is on one page.** **Settings → Video player** is the complete list —
  HDR, Auto frame rate, Surround sound, Auto-play next, Live preview, Preview sound and Mini player
  sit there alongside the decoder, zoom, volume, subtitle and Live TV settings, so you never have to
  remember which of two screens a setting was on. The main Settings page keeps **Video player**; the
  quick-toggle chips above it still cover the most-used switches.
- 🩺 **Error log** (App, the last row, after About) — the last crash plus the most recent playback
  failures, newest first. **Export** writes them to `OwnTV-playback-report.txt` in **Downloads**, crash
  first; attach that file when reporting a problem. A crash is saved as it happens, so it is still there
  after the app has closed itself. Searching Settings for *error* or *crash* opens this page directly.
- 🌐 **Custom DNS** (Network → DNS) — use the TV’s normal DNS, choose Google, Cloudflare or Quad9,
  or enter your own DNS server / DNS‑over‑HTTPS address. Your enabled state and selected server are
  saved immediately and restored after restarting OwnTV. **Test DNS** checks the current entry before
  you rely on it.
- 🔤 **Font customization** (Appearance) — open one popup to set main-app text from **60% to 140%** and
  popup text independently from **50% to 120%**, both in 5% steps, then choose separate fonts for the
  **main interface** and **popups**. The separate **Popup size** row scales dialog/menu boxes from **50% to
  120%** without changing their text; oversized text scrolls inside the panel instead of resizing it.
  Available fonts are **System Sans, Monospace, Lora, Playfair Display, Dancing Script, and Poppins**.
  Press **Apply** to save,
  **Reset** to return to 100% / System Sans / Lora, or **Back** to discard staged changes. The setting
  works with every interface language; Android supplies compatible fallback characters when a chosen
  font does not contain a language's script. It is app-wide, survives restarts, and is included in
  backup/restore. Subtitles are not changed here — use **Subtitle appearance** for those.
- 🎛️ **Remote Shortcuts** (Content) — assign short or long presses of spare colour, number, channel and
  media keys to 25 app, browsing and player actions. The default CH+/Rewind and CH−/Fast-forward paging
  setup and its two skip counts live here; essential navigation remains protected, and assignments travel
  with Backup & Restore. See **Remote shortcuts** above for the complete action and safety list.
- 🚀 **App startup** — where each profile opens: **Home**, **Last channel** (auto‑plays the channel
  you last watched), **Live · Favorites** (lands you right inside the favourites list), or
  **Specific channel**. The channel picker is searchable and D-pad friendly. OwnTV remembers a stable
  profile-specific channel reference (provider ID, then name, then the local row as a fallback), and
  Backup & Restore carries it to another device. With one unlocked profile, OwnTV starts the channel
  immediately; with multiple profiles or a PIN lock, profile selection/authentication comes first.
  A hidden, Kids-restricted, disconnected or missing channel is never auto-played; OwnTV opens Home
  and shows a message instead.
- 🗂️ **Browsing & lists** (Content) — six toggles, two for each of **Live TV / Movies / Series**.
  **Remember last category** (on) reopens the section on the category you left instead of *All*.
  **Remember last item** (off) makes each category keep its own scroll position instead of starting at
  the top — with Live TV also restoring the last focused channel. These are independent of **App startup
  → Last channel**.
- 🌈 **HDR** — use HDR output when the video and TV support it. Turn on for HDR/Dolby Vision content.
  It steers the **compatibility (mpv) player** only; the standard player hands HDR straight to your TV,
  which decides for itself.
- 🎞️ **Auto frame rate** (Video player, off by default) — in full screen, asks the TV to switch to a refresh rate matching
  the video (24/25/30/50/60 fps) and hands the display back on exit, so 24fps films and 25/50fps
  broadcasts stop juddering on a 60Hz panel. Works for Live TV and VOD on both engines, and never
  changes resolution. Streams that don't declare a frame rate (most live channels) are now **measured**,
  so it works there too; if a channel judders while the setting is off and your TV has a suitable mode,
  OwnTV offers to turn it on — once ever. Because a measured rate wanders slightly, readings are pulled
  onto the nearest real frame rate and a second switch can't follow the first within five seconds — so
  one channel no longer blanks the picture several times over. Where the TV reports it (Android 12+), a
  refresh rate it can reach *without* blanking is preferred. Enable it only if your TV or receiver
  switches refresh rates cleanly without a visible HDMI re-handshake. The v4.1.6 update resets it to Off
  once for existing users; changing it afterward is remembered normally, and Off disables both ExoPlayer
  and mpv frame-rate requests. **On a TV running Android below 12** the set never reports which rates it
  can switch to smoothly, so a change can black the screen out for a second or two mid-programme: v4.2.0
  resets the setting to Off once on those devices, warns before you switch it back on, and never offers
  to enable it for a juddering channel there. Turning it on anyway is fine — that choice is then left
  alone. **Your TV's own setting wins.** Android TV has its own *Match content frame rate* option
  (Android 12+): set it to **Never** and OwnTV leaves the display alone whatever this setting says,
  and stops offering to turn it on; set it to **Seamless only** and OwnTV restricts itself to changes
  your TV can make without a visible black gap. **Always** — and any TV without the option — behaves
  as described above.
- 🧩 **Hardware decoder** (Video Player Settings) — hardware decoding is on for smooth 4K; switch to software
  only if a specific codec misbehaves. Turning it **off** now applies to **both players** (it used to
  reach only the compatibility one, which left normal Live TV on the hardware decoder anyway). The
  hardware decoder stays available as a backstop, so nothing that played before can stop playing —
  expect slower decoding and, on some devices, a resolution ceiling. Stream info's **Decoder** row shows
  which one is really in use.
- 📡 **Live latency** (Video Player Settings) — how close to the live edge Live TV plays, trading latency
  against stability: **Low latency**, **Balanced** (default), **Stable**, or a **Custom** buffer in seconds.
  It applies on the next channel open, to live streams only, on both engines, and it now sizes the real
  buffer on both (it used to be little more than a hint the standard player's stream type ignored).
  **Balanced** changes nothing (so it can't regress a working stream); picking **Low latency** or a
  below‑Balanced custom value warns first that a smaller buffer can stutter on weaker connections.
  On a **very high-bitrate channel — 4K especially — you get less time than the number says**, because
  there is a limit on how much video can be held in memory at once; the setting now says so rather
  than looking as though it were ignored. **Live latency per playlist** right below it lets one
  provider keep a deeper (or shallower) buffer than the rest — pick the playlist, then the value, with
  **Follow setting** as the default.
- ⏱️ **Pre-buffer live streams** (Video Player Settings → Live TV, off by default) — collect this much
  video (2 / 5 / 10 s) before a channel starts, and again after a stutter, instead of starting on the
  first frame. It is an **amount of video, not a wait**: a fast provider delivers 10s of video in well
  under a second, so the channel still starts instantly. Use it on a provider that freezes every few
  seconds. **Pre-buffer per playlist** right below it lets one troublesome playlist differ from the rest.
  Stream info's **Live buffer** row shows what the player actually applied. Some channels can't supply that
  much video at once (a 4K feed on a provider with a short live window) — OwnTV notices after a few seconds
  and reopens just that channel without the pre-buffer, for the rest of the session. Separately, a channel
  that loads plenty of video but still never shows a picture (a provider-side timing fault, most often seen
  with **Prefer HLS** on) is now given up on after a few seconds rather than spinning, so it moves on to its
  original format or the compatibility player.
- ⛔ **Give up on a channel after** (Video Player Settings → Live TV, **30 s** by default) — how long a
  live channel may show nothing before OwnTV stops trying and tells you. Behind the scenes it works
  through up to four player-and-format combinations, each with its own timeout, so a channel your
  provider has removed used to sit on black for about a minute and a half. Choose **15 / 30 / 60 s**, or
  **Never** to keep trying — worth it only on a provider whose channels genuinely take that long to
  open. A wait the provider itself asks for ("account busy, try again in 20 s") is **not** counted
  against it, so a channel queued behind one is never mistaken for a dead one.
- 🪟 **Mini‑player** (Settings → Video player → Mini player) — **one popup** holding both settings: the
  docked live‑PiP window's **size** (percentage of screen width, −/+ in 5% steps) and its **screen
  position**, offered as a six‑cell grid laid out like the TV screen (top and bottom, left/centre/right)
  so the cell you highlight is where the window will sit. Both apply as you press; **Reset** returns the
  size and the position to their defaults together. Both are also adjustable **on the fly** from the
  mini‑player's own resize / move controls, and the window scales with your TV size and UI zoom.
- 🎬 **Movies & Series player** (Video Player Settings) — which engine plays movies/episodes first:
  **mpv** (default — widest format support incl. DTS/TrueHD audio, plus the A/V sync fix) or
  **ExoPlayer** (try it **only if movies/episodes won't start** on your device — it can't decode
  DTS/TrueHD audio and has no A/V sync fix). Either way, if the chosen player fails, the other is
  tried automatically before an error is shown. That fallback is **not remembered** — every movie and
  episode starts on your chosen engine every time. The player's **info overlay** shows which engine is
  active.
- ♻️ **Reset saved player choices** (Video Player Settings, right under the setting above) — flipping a
  single movie/episode with the ⇄ MPV/EXO pill saves that choice for that one item. This row shows how
  many are saved and clears them all, so everything follows the **Movies & Series player** setting
  again. Live TV's per‑channel compatibility mode is a separate list and is kept.
- 🔊 **Default volume** (Video Player Settings, 0–150%) — the level everything starts at. A volume you set
  in the player is saved for **that** channel/film and wins over this; everything you haven't touched
  follows this setting. Handy when a whole provider runs quiet. **Mute is never saved.**
- ♻️ **Reset saved zoom / Reset saved volume** (Video Player Settings) — two separate rows, each showing
  how many items it will clear and asking first. Each is paired with its own default (**Default zoom**,
  **Default volume**), and clearing one leaves the other alone.
- ⏩ **Seek step** (Video Player Settings) — how far the rewind/forward buttons and the seek bar jump in a
  movie or episode: **5 / 10 / 15 / 30 / 60 s** (default 10 s). It also applies to the skip buttons on a
  **Bluetooth remote** and in the **system media notification**, which used to be fixed at 30 s.
- ⏪ **Live rewind step** (Video Player Settings) — the same for the catch‑up archive buttons on a live
  channel: **10 / 15 / 30 / 60 / 120 s** (default 30 s). Deliberately separate from Seek step — stepping
  through a film and stepping back through a live archive are different jobs.
- 🎞️ **Deinterlacing** (Video Player Settings, **Off** by default) — smooths the comb‑shaped lines some
  old interlaced channels show on movement. **It only does something when OwnTV draws the picture
  itself** — hardware decoding off, or after a software fallback. On the normal direct‑to‑screen path
  the video reaches your TV untouched and no filter can run, so leave this off unless you have turned
  hardware decoding off for a channel that needs it.
- 📊 **Measured stream stats** (Video Player Settings → Diagnostics) — on by default. When on, the
  player's **info overlay** measures live fps, bitrate and dropped frames for streams that don't
  declare them (most Xtream live TV). Turn it **off** only if a low‑end TV ever stutters — it affects
  the diagnostic numbers only, never the actual video.
- 🗣️ **Preferred audio / subtitle language** (Video Player Settings) — when a stream carries several
  tracks, the matching language is selected instead of whichever track the provider listed first.
  A preferred subtitle is now also turned on automatically across both players — even when the audio
  uses that same language. Language variants such as English `eng`, `en`, and `en-US` match, while an
  unrelated subtitle stays off when the preferred language is unavailable. Changes affect current playback.
- 💬 **Subtitle appearance** (Video Player Settings) — a menu with a preview, a **Customize subtitles**
  switch, and then **Font**, **Size**, **Text color**, **Position** (six anchors: top/bottom ×
  left/center/right) and **Background transparency** (None → Solid in 10% steps). **Size holds one row
  per player** — ExoPlayer and MPV — above a preview showing both at once, because the two draw the same
  size differently and one shared value can never suit both; **OK** on a row steps it through Small →
  Normal → Large → Extra large. Upgrading keeps your old size on both until you change one. Font choices are
  **Default, System Sans, Monospace, Lora, Playfair Display, Dancing Script, and Poppins**, and apply
  across both players and app-drawn subtitle overlays. **Each option starts at "Default", and Default
  leaves that aspect alone** — including authored font styling. If you set only the background, the
  stream's own colours and broadcaster styling remain intact. Image subtitles
  (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB) are pictures and always render as authored.
- 📤 **External player** (Video Player Settings) — opens a popup with **separate On/Off switches for
  Live TV, Movies and Series**, so you can send live channels to VLC (or MX Player, …) while keeping
  movies in OwnTV, or any other mix. **Downloads** follow the Movies or Series switch, depending on
  what was downloaded. Live TV is **off** by default. You can also play a **single item** externally
  without any setting: **long‑press OK** on a channel, movie or episode and choose **Play in external
  player** (Downloads have an **External** button). Note: resume position, the OwnTV controls and
  next/previous aren't available while an external app plays.
- 📼 **Catch‑up** (Playback → Catch‑up) — the same popup that holds the catch‑up **timezone/offset** now
  also has **Play catch‑up in**: **OwnTV player** (default), **External player**, or **Always ask**.
  With *Always ask*, pressing **Watch from start** on a recording asks which player to use each time.
- 🌦️ **Weather** — its own submenu: **Show weather** (top‑bar chip on/off), **Custom location** (city or
  "lat,lon"; blank = auto‑detect — set this if a VPN shows the wrong city), and **Temperature unit**
  (**°C / °F**).
- 🔊 **Surround sound** — three choices, answering *who decodes Dolby/DTS*. Press OK to cycle.
  - **Auto** (default, recommended) — try surround, and switch back to stereo automatically if your TV
    or soundbar turns out not to play it properly.
  - **Stereo only** — OwnTV decodes everything and sends plain stereo. The right answer for **TV
    speakers or a stereo soundbar**, and the one to pick if sound ever lags behind the picture.
  - **Surround** — send Dolby/DTS to a **real 5.1/7.1 receiver** to decode.

  Whichever you pick, OwnTV watches the audio output: if your equipment accepts the sound and then goes
  silent, rejects the format, or keeps stuttering, it **falls back to stereo on its own**, tells you, and
  gets sound back in a few seconds. A gap in a *file's own* audio timing doesn't count — the player
  re‑syncs itself and you keep your surround. That safety net runs in **all three modes** and can't be
  switched off. Once it
  has fired it stays on stereo for the rest of the session (so channel or player switches can't lose the
  sound again) — restart the app, or change this setting, to give your equipment another try. When a movie
  or episode is using **ExoPlayer**, this recovery briefly rebuilds the picture on a clean video surface
  and resumes at the same position; it does not treat the audio change as a reason to switch to mpv.
  Resuming a film or episode from Home also opens directly at its saved position, so Auto surround is not
  torn down and rebuilt during startup.

  Applies to **Live TV, Movies and Series on both players**. Changing it re-opens whatever is playing.
  If sound and picture still drift, nudge it live with the player's **Audio → A/V sync**, and turn on
  **Remember this delay** if that particular channel or film is always out. **Video Player Settings →
  Reset saved audio sync** forgets them all again.
- 🩺 **Playback log** (Playback) — the last 25 playback entries with their plain‑English reason, stream
  details and device info. It records **failures**, **events** (a decode rescue, a switch between
  players, the stereo safety net firing, a provider that only allows one stream) and any **report** you
  saved from the player's info overlay. If a channel or movie errored and you dismissed the message,
  open this to read exactly what happened — perfect for bug reports, no computer needed. **Export**
  writes everything to **`Download/owntv-playback-report.txt`** and shows the path. The public Download
  folder is created automatically when missing, and exporting again replaces the previous report, so a
  normal TV file manager or USB-copy tool can access it without ADB.
- 🔍 **Detailed playback logging** (Video Player Settings → Diagnostics, off by default) — turn this on
  when you're chasing a playback problem, then reproduce it and **Export** the log: the report will
  include the full live‑playback trace. It only changes what is written down, never playback itself.
- 🔄 **Check updates on startup** — get notified when a newer version is on GitHub Releases.
- 💾 **Backup & Restore** — export/restore your profiles, sources, customizations, favorites, history,
  resume positions, **manual Move positions** and app settings. Export starts by asking **which
  profiles** to include — the file contains only the selected profiles and their data. Your **current
  profile starts ticked**; add the others yourself. Including a **PIN-locked profile** that isn't your
  current one requires entering its PIN; without the PIN it simply stays out of the backup. Then choose
  the data sections as before. Backups are saved as a
  single **`owntv-backup.own`** file, which also carries your **background image** (with the App
  settings section) so the wallpaper comes back on the other TV instead of blank. On export you can set
  a **backup password**, which encrypts the **whole file** — playlists, profiles, history and the saved
  secrets (source & proxy passwords, your own TMDB and OpenSubtitles API keys, each profile's
  **OpenSubtitles login**, and your **profile / Customize PINs**)
  — so nothing in it can be read without that password. **Keep it safe: a protected backup cannot be
  opened at all if you lose the password.** Without a password the file is not encrypted and those
  secrets are simply left out — so after restoring a passwordless backup you re-enter your playlist
  and proxy passwords, and any profile PINs.

  **OwnTV never uses Android's automatic backup.** Google Drive backup and device-to-device transfer
  are both switched off for the app, because they would copy the raw database — playlist passwords and
  API keys included — with no backup password anywhere in the process. This screen is the only way
  OwnTV data moves between devices, which is what makes the password promise above meaningful. Restoring a protected `.own` asks for the password **first**, then shows
  what's inside; there is no Skip, since nothing can be restored without it. **Older `.json` backups
  still restore** — those ask for the password after you pick the sections, and **Skip** restores
  everything except the saved passwords, as before. **Restore merges — it never deletes your existing profiles or
  sources:** a profile with the same **name** as one already on the device is updated from the backup,
  profiles only in the backup are added, and everything else stays put (that's also why profile names
  must be unique — the app matches by name). A playlist already on the device is updated from the
  backup — its name, its Live/Movies/Series scope, **Prefer HLS** and its per‑playlist **Pre‑buffer**
  all come across, not just the credentials. Backups also preserve your **per‑source Auto refresh** choices,
  your **default source**, any **compatibility‑mode / per‑item engine pins** (Live and Movies/Series),
  your saved **per‑item zoom and volume**, your **downloaded subtitles** — the files themselves, which
  subtitle you had chosen per film or episode, and any timing offsets you nudged by hand —
  your **custom TMDB names** (long‑press → Custom TMDB name), recent searches, your **startup screen**,
  global **Live TV** and **Movies & Series player** choices, **Quick** pinned rows and order, all four
  arranged **long‑press menus**, and which **profile you were using**,
  so a restored setup behaves exactly like the original. Older backup files still restore fine — anything
  they don't contain just keeps its default. (An older OwnTV version cannot read a new `.own` file, so keep
  a `.json` backup if you plan to go back to one.) **Move a backup between TVs over Wi‑Fi:** choose **Restore
  from another device** (also offered in the setup wizard) to show a PIN + QR — a phone, tablet or computer on the
  same network uploads a backup file straight to the TV, which then runs the normal restore. **Send to
  another device** does the reverse, serving the exported backup for a remote device to download. No USB
  stick or cloud needed; the local USB/file flows still work as before.
- 🧹 **Clear watch history** — wipe a profile's recently‑watched / continue rows.
- 📥 **Downloads** — download movies/episodes for offline play; pick the **Download folder** (app storage or
  external). To browse outside app storage, choose **Grant full storage access** in the folder picker — it
  opens OwnTV's app-settings page where you enable **Allow management of all files** (on Android 10 and
  below a normal permission dialog appears instead), then press Back to return to the picker.

## 🛠️ Building your own custom M3U playlist

Making your own `.m3u`/`.m3u8` by hand (or with a script)? OwnTV decides which tab each entry lands in
**purely from the `#EXTINF` line** — the tag you put on it, not the file it points to. Get the line right
and your content sorts itself into **Live TV**, **Movies** or **Series** automatically.

**The rule OwnTV uses (in order):**

1. If the entry is tagged **series** → it goes to the **Series** tab.
2. Otherwise, if it's tagged as a **movie/VOD** → it goes to the **Movies** grid.
3. Otherwise (no VOD tag at all) → it stays in **Live TV**.

The tag can be written as either `type="…"` **or** `tvg-type="…"` — both are accepted:

| You want it under… | Add this attribute to the `#EXTINF` line |
|---|---|
| **Live TV** | *(nothing — any untagged entry is treated as a live channel)* |
| **Movies** | `type="movie"` **or** `type="vod"` **or** `tvg-type="movie"` **or** `tvg-type="vod"` |
| **Series** | `type="series"` **or** `tvg-type="series"` |

### Anatomy of a line

Every item is **two lines**: an `#EXTINF` metadata line, then the stream URL on the next line.

```
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="..." tvg-logo="..." group-title="...",Display Name
http://your-server/stream.ext
```

- **`group-title="…"`** — the **category name inside the tab** (e.g. a Live TV category, a Movies
  category, or a Series category). Entries with the same `group-title` are grouped together.
- **`tvg-logo="…"`** — poster/channel logo URL (optional).
- **`tvg-id="…"`** — for **Live TV**, this is the EPG channel id used to match guide data (optional).
- **Display Name** — the text after the final comma. This is the title shown in the app.

### Live TV example

```
#EXTM3U url-tvg="http://your-server/epg.xml"
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="bbc1.uk" tvg-logo="http://logo/bbc1.png" group-title="UK Channels",BBC One
http://your-server/live/bbc1.ts
```

> `url-tvg="…"` on the `#EXTM3U` header line is picked up as the playlist's EPG source automatically if
> you haven't set one. Catch-up attributes (`catchup="…"`, `catchup-source="…"`, `catchup-days="7"`)
> are also read on live entries — the `append`, `shift`, `flussonic` and `xc` styles are all supported,
> and `{utc}` / `{lutc}` / `{now}` / date tokens in `catchup-source` are filled in.

**Per-item HTTP options** are supported too, for an entry whose server needs its own User-Agent or
Referer. They work on live, movie and series entries alike, and are sent by both players and by an
external player. Any of these forms works, on the lines just after `#EXTINF` (or as a suffix on the
URL):

```
#EXTINF:-1 group-title="UK Channels",Some Restream
#EXTVLCOPT:http-user-agent=MyPlayer/1.0
#EXTVLCOPT:http-referrer=http://example.com/
http://your-server/live/restream.ts

#EXTINF:-1 group-title="UK Channels",Another Restream
http://your-server/live/other.ts|User-Agent=MyPlayer/1.0&Referer=http://example.com/
```

`#EXTHTTP:{"cookie":"…"}` and `#KODIPROP:inputstream.adaptive.stream_headers=…` are read as well. A
per-item User-Agent wins over the playlist-wide one set in **Manage sources**.

### Movies example

```
#EXTINF:-1 type="movie" tvg-logo="http://logo/inception.jpg" group-title="Action",Inception (2010)
http://your-server/movie/inception.mkv
```

### Series example — this is the important one

Tag each **episode line** with `type="series"`, and put the **season/episode marker in the Display Name**.
OwnTV reads the marker to group episodes into shows, seasons and episodes:

```
#EXTINF:-1 type="series" group-title="Drama",Stranger Things S01E01
http://your-server/series/st-s01e01.mkv
#EXTINF:-1 type="series" group-title="Drama",Stranger Things S01E02
http://your-server/series/st-s01e02.mkv
#EXTINF:-1 type="series" group-title="Drama",Stranger Things S02E01
http://your-server/series/st-s02e01.mkv
```

- The text **before** the marker becomes the **show name** — so all three lines above merge into one show
  *Stranger Things* with a Season 1 (2 episodes) and a Season 2 (1 episode).
- The text **after** the marker becomes the **episode title** (optional), e.g.
  `…,Stranger Things S01E01 - The Vanishing`.
- **Supported markers** (case-insensitive):
  - `S01E05` — also written `s1e5`, `S01 E05`, `S01.E05`, `S01-E05`.
  - `1x05` — the "1x05" style.
- **Keep the show name identical** across its episodes (spelling/case aside — matching is
  case-insensitive) so they group into the same show.
- If an episode line has **no marker**, it's still added, but as a plain sequential episode under that
  name — so always include a marker when you can.

> **Tip:** the `group-title` on a series entry becomes its **category** in the Series tab, not the show
> name — the show name always comes from the Display Name before the marker.

## 💡 Tips

- **Long‑press OK** is your friend — favourites, rename, hide, match EPG and catch‑up all live there.
- A channel buffering or showing artifacts on 4K? **MPV/EXO toggle → compatibility mode** usually fixes it.
- Live channels from one provider glitching every few seconds while another provider is fine? Try
  **Prefer HLS for Live TV** on that source — some Xtream panels are far steadier over HLS. Press
  **Test HLS support** just above it first to see whether that provider serves HLS at all.
- Audio out of sync on a VOD? **Audio → A/V sync** and nudge ± until lips match — then **Remember this
  delay** if it is always that title.
- **Update says the download didn't finish, or there isn't enough space?** In‑app updates need room for
  the new version twice over (about 120 MB free). Clear some storage and press Try again — OwnTV now
  refuses a half‑finished download instead of handing it to Android, which used to show only
  "App not installed".
- **Guide looks blank when you first open it?** (especially with catch‑up channels) Try: **Settings → EPG** → tap Edit → delete your EPG source(s), then **add them again** and sync fresh. The v4.0.0 update changed how EPG loads, and old cached data needs to be cleared and reimported. Once done, the guide displays immediately.
